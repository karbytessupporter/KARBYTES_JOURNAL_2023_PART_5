<p>karbytes_0: <span style="background:#ffff00">&#8220;The question is: are you reading these words or are you writing these words?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;What karbytes_0 means to express is that each person at all times is subject to being exposed to electromagnetic waves which transmit messages exclusively to that person&#8217;s nervous system by &#8216;mind hackers&#8217; which causes the target of those transmissions to &#8216;hear voices&#8217; in its head which other persons probably do not hear which are at an optimum volume and timing to avoid being consciously detected. Such externally sourced &#8216;thoughts&#8217; could be mistaken by the receiver of those electromagnetic wave transmissions to be that person&#8217;s original thoughts (i.e. thoughts generated by that person&#8217;s brain rather than from incoming electromagnetic signals transmitting &#8216;thoughts&#8217; from a location external to that person&#8217;s brain).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_2: &#8220;To answer the question karbytes_0 is asking, I will say the following: I am writing these words if I am thinking (and I claim that I am because these words seem to require more effort than passively listening without intentionally generating words which match my personal language and cultural preferences).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_3: &#8220;What karybtes_2 says inspires me to suggest that what karbytes_2 implies by effort to think specific thoughts as &#8216;ego energy&#8217; (i.e. cognitive resources used to sustain an ego (which is a sort of <span style="background:#00ffff">time crystal (which is a pattern of phenomena (which are differences in localized energy) whose pattern is evident only in four-dimensional space-time and not in fewer dimensions (because time is needed to see the digital structure which could be subjectively represented as a piece of music playing to an audience capable of rendering that music as the author of that music experiences that piece of music))</span>).&#8221;</p>
