<p><span style="background: #ffff00">Last night I made some small yet (personally) significant updates to probability.html and probability.js (which will be included in the next code tutorial web page of <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>). That helped set my mind to be in a better mood than otherwise (because I felt bad that I had not touched any of my code for approximately three weeks and now feel that I am getting back on track with my code (and I think it is good to work on code a minimum of at least once per week, but I seem to have at least three hours per day when I am scheduled to work the graveyard shift (1AM to 8:30AM) at the parcel sortation and delivery vehicle loading facility to work on code (which means I could feasibly work on code almost every day)). That&#8217;s good. What also made today feel especially uplifting and cozy was finding some good science articles which were published within the past two months and sharing those articles on my Twitter and Minds pages. Those two articles rekindle the enthusiasm I had back when I was approximately 21 years old and going to the Computer History Museum with my best friend and domestic/romantic/sexual partner <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SED (i.e. Spencer Eugene Dyer)</a> (who I have been estranged from for several years) to celebrate my twenty-first birthday. I knew that I had found my &#8220;element&#8221; in information technology (and I have a slight preference for hardware over software because I am more interested in physics than in math (but I think both are essential for me to dig as deeply into as possible during my lifespan)).</span></p>
